# Creating a Reverse Dictionary

This is the companion repository of the article [Creating a Reverse Dictionary](https://tomassetti.me/creating-a-reverse-dictionary/). A tutorial that explains what is Word2Vec and how to use it to create a reverse dictionary, i.e., a program that asks for a definition and returns words corresponding to that definition.

This repository includes the code of the program, written in Python. It does not include the GoogleNews dataset necessary to run the program. You would have to download it yourself from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM) and place inside the folder `models`. The folder already contains the file `words.txt`.

You can install the requirements with the usual pip command.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
